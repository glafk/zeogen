Code used for the Master's thesis "Discovery of Novel Zeolite Structures Using Crystal Generative Models"

The data folder contains a sample dataset consisting of 2000 samples of the RHO zeolite generated with [Zeoran](https://github.com/promerma/zeoran)

The clean_CIF.py in the source folder is a script that removes all oxygen atoms from the CIF file to reduce the atoms in the representation.
